# Quorum

An incremental systems design game. A player grows a startup by building and tuning the system that
serves its users, one bottleneck at a time. The full design is in [the design document](https://wiki.playquorum.dev/design).

This file is the game vocabulary. Code, UI copy, and the design documents use these words. Real
engineering terms that the game teaches are in the
[engineering glossary](https://wiki.playquorum.dev/glossary).

## Language

### The company

**Company**:
One play-through, from founding to Exit. It has a name and a logo, and the browser keeps any number
of Companies.
_Avoid_: run, save, game, playthrough

**Company file**:
The stored Company in the browser: its name, logo, Venture, Mutators, and Game. The Companies page
lists them.
_Avoid_: save, save slot, savegame

**Venture**:
The kind of Company the player founds. It sets the traffic profile, demand shape, constraints, and signature incidents.
_Avoid_: scenario, mode, industry, class

**Mutator**:
An optional rule that makes a Company harder in exchange for more Legacy.
_Avoid_: modifier, handicap, challenge

**Era**:
A stage of the Company, from Garage to Public. Each Era brings new Request kinds and a new failure mode.
_Avoid_: stage, level, chapter, tier

**Milestone**:
The user count, and in the Pre-IPO Era the checklist, that ends an Era.
_Avoid_: goal, threshold, gate

**Funding round**:
The offer of a Grant for Equity at a Milestone. The player can raise or decline.
_Avoid_: investment, raise (as a noun), stage

**Users**:
The people the Company serves. They send demand, and they grow or leave with Apdex. From Series C, each region counts its own Users, which grow or leave with that region's Apdex. Half of new Users are fickle and half steady; steady Users leave at a fifth of the rate.
_Avoid_: customers, players, audience, DAU

**Churn breakdown**:
The list of what takes Apdex from each region's Users, by Request kind and cause, with the rate at which they leave.
_Avoid_: churn report, why panel, attribution

### The design

**Board**:
The surface where the player places Nodes and draws Links. One Board per region.
_Avoid_: canvas, map, grid, lab

**Component**:
An entry in the fixed catalog that a player can place, with its own cost, capacity, and options.
_Avoid_: building, node type, item

**Managed Component**:
A Component that stands for a third-party service. It costs nothing to place, charges per use, and has outages the player cannot fix.
_Avoid_: external service, SaaS, vendor

**Node**:
One placed copy of a Component, with its own size, options, and card.
_Avoid_: instance, box, entity, machine

**Link**:
A directed network call from one Node to another, with a latency, timeout, and retry policy.
_Avoid_: edge, wire, connection, pipe

**Design**:
The Nodes and Links on all Boards of a Company.
_Avoid_: topology, blueprint, layout, architecture

**Stack**:
The language, runtime variant, and framework that an App Server or Worker runs.
_Avoid_: tech, build, loadout

**Instance type**:
The family and size of a compute or data Node, which sets its vCPU, RAM, and price.
_Avoid_: level, tier, spec

**Zone**:
A failure domain inside a region. Every zoned Node sits in one; a call between zones adds latency and Egress, and a zone outage takes down every Node in it.
_Avoid_: availability zone, AZ (in UI copy), datacenter, rack

**Region**:
A continent the Company runs in: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, or South America. Each open region has its own Users and its own tab on the Board; a call between regions pays the round trip.
_Avoid_: datacenter, cloud region (in UI copy), geo

**Mirror**:
A region built from another region's Nodes and Links, after the player picks where each data Node's writes go. It stays linked to its source, and applying a plan brings it back in sync. Research `infra-as-code` unlocks it.
_Avoid_: clone, duplicate, copy (that is a Node's machine)

**Drift**:
Every difference between a Mirror and its source that is not an override: source changes the Mirror is behind on, and hand changes on the Mirror. Pulumi and Alchemy plans show a hand change only after the player reads live state.
_Avoid_: desync, divergence, config skew

**IaC tool**:
The infrastructure-as-code tool the Company writes Mirrors in: Terraform, Pulumi, or Alchemy. It sets how a plan finds hand changes: on every plan (Terraform), or after Refresh (Pulumi) or Check drift (Alchemy).
_Avoid_: provisioner, deployer, IaC (alone in UI copy)

**Region tab**:
The Board's view of one region: its Nodes, the global ones, and the Nodes elsewhere they link to. Every tab shows one Design.
_Avoid_: board (for a single region), map, planet

**Quorum**:
The replicas a Wide-column Store waits for: R on a read and W on a write, of N per key. R + W > N means every read sees the latest write.
_Avoid_: consensus (that is Distributed SQL), majority

**Topology**:
How more than one Database holds the rows: single primary, sharded, or multi-leader.
_Avoid_: peer, layout (that is a Design)

**Data Group**:
The Databases and Read Replicas inside one box. A group holds one dataset, and its topology says how its Databases share the rows, so two groups hold different rows.
_Avoid_: cluster (that is a Component), shard group

**Failover**:
Promoting a Read Replica to the primary when the primary is gone. An asynchronous replica loses writes still in flight; a synchronous one loses none.
_Avoid_: promotion (alone in UI copy)

**Spread**:
A Wide-column Store or Distributed SQL Node that replicates across the open regions, so it serves through a Region outage.
_Avoid_: global table, geo-replicated

**Hot key**:
One key that takes a large share of reads, so the shard that holds it saturates while the rest idle.
_Avoid_: celebrity problem (in UI copy), hotspot

**Copy**:
One of the identical machines a scaled App Server or Worker Node runs. An Autoscaler adds and removes copies; the Node stays one card.
_Avoid_: replica (that is the read replica Component), instance, pod (in UI copy)

**Standby**:
A second, idle box for a data Node in another zone. It takes over within seconds when the Node's zone fails, and doubles the Node's Burn.
_Avoid_: failover node, secondary, hot spare

**Circuit breaker**:
A switch on a Link that stops its calls for a few seconds once half of them fail, so retries cannot keep a struggling Node overloaded.
_Avoid_: fuse, kill switch

**Load shedding**:
An App Server near saturation drops the lowest-value request kinds first, so checkouts survive an overload.
_Avoid_: throttling, rate limiting

**Data Warehouse**:
A Component that answers report scans in columns, paid per scan, so reports stop evicting the primary Database's buffer cache.
_Avoid_: OLAP, analytics DB

**GPU Node**:
A Component that serves AI prompts in tokens per second; cheaper per prompt than the LLM API only while it stays busy.
_Avoid_: inference server, GPU box

**Service**:
A codebase with its own deploy pipeline, owned by one Team. Every App Server and Worker belongs to one.
_Avoid_: app, microservice, group

**Playbook**:
A saved part of a Design that the player can place in one action. Playbooks survive Exits.
_Avoid_: blueprint, template, preset

### Traffic

**Request kind**:
A class of work that Users send, such as `page`, `write`, or `ai`, with a value, a cost profile, and an Apdex target.
_Avoid_: request type, traffic type, file type

**Request mix**:
The share of demand that each Request kind takes. An Era sets a base mix for the default Venture, another Venture replaces it with its own profile, Features move it, and a Product lever raises one kind. The shares add up to one, so the mix says where a user's attention goes, not how much attention they have.
_Avoid_: traffic split, ratio, distribution, allocation

**Product lever**:
A product change, built with Dev Hours, that raises one Request kind's share of the Request mix. It has three steps, and it never creates a kind.
_Avoid_: surface, demand lever, traffic lever, dial, slider

**Product lever step**:
One of the three builds of a Product lever. Each step raises the kind's share further, costs Dev Hours, and lowers user growth.
_Avoid_: level, tier, upgrade

**Backend kind**:
A class of work that a Node sends to the data tier or to a Managed Component, such as `q-read` or `infer`. It earns nothing by itself.
_Avoid_: query type, internal request

**Stranded**:
Requests that reach a Node with no outbound Link that accepts them. They count as errors.
_Avoid_: dropped, lost, orphaned

**Task**:
The backend kind an App Server sends to a Queue for the part of a request that can go async. A Worker runs it later; the user waits only for the enqueue.
_Avoid_: job (a later request kind), message

**Queue depth**:
Tasks a Queue holds that no Worker has taken yet. It is saved with the Game, and a growing depth is the first sign Workers are too slow.
_Avoid_: backlog (the Team's work list), lag

**Egress**:
The Burn for bytes sent to the internet: responses from App Servers at the origin price, and pages a CDN answers at the cheaper edge price. Billed from Seed.
_Avoid_: bandwidth cost, transfer fee

### The simulation

**Simulation**:
The pure model that turns a Design and demand into the Ledger.
_Avoid_: engine, solver, kernel

**Step**:
One advance of the Simulation, 100 ms of sim time.
_Avoid_: tick, frame, turn

**Sim clock**:
The clock for rates and operational events. One sim second is one real second at 1× speed. It runs
only while the Company is open and unpaused.
_Avoid_: game time, real time

**Paused**:
The state of a Company whose board is closed or whose clock is stopped. The Simulation does not
advance, so no rate, queue, Incident, Study, or calendar minute moves. The Company resumes at the
Step it stopped on.
_Avoid_: offline, away, idle

**Calendar**:
The compressed clock for days, weeks, and quarters. One sim second is one calendar minute.
_Avoid_: date, in-game time

**Ledger**:
Every figure the Simulation derives at a Step. It is the single source of truth for every number the game shows.
_Avoid_: stats, state, model

**Capacity**:
The most work a Node can do per second, set by its tightest limit: CPU, slots, memory, connections, or network.
_Avoid_: throughput, power, max rps

**Utilization**:
Offered work divided by Capacity.
_Avoid_: load (alone), usage

**Bottleneck**:
The one Node whose extra Capacity would earn the most revenue right now. The Board marks it.
_Avoid_: chokepoint, weak link

**Load change**:
The split of a Node's change in Utilization into demand, cost per request, and Capacity.
_Avoid_: load delta, utilization diff

**Amplification**:
The calls one Users' request makes to a Node across every hop, with the share that are retries and Cache misses.
_Avoid_: fan-out (that is a shard scan), multiplier

**Work share**:
A Request kind's share of the resource that limits a Node, as opposed to its share of incoming traffic.
_Avoid_: CPU share, cost share

**Cost receipt**:
The base cost of one request of a kind at a Node and each factor that multiplies it.
_Avoid_: breakdown, profile, flame graph

**Apdex**:
The share of requests that satisfy users, with tolerating requests counted as half. It sets revenue and user growth.
_Avoid_: satisfaction, happiness, patience

### Reliability

**Incident**:
An event that stresses the Design, chosen by the incident director to test a weakness.
_Avoid_: event, disaster, outage (as the general term)

**SLO**:
The availability target for the current Era, measured per calendar week.
_Avoid_: uptime goal, target

**Error budget**:
The failures that the SLO allows. Spending it changes team velocity.
_Avoid_: downtime allowance

**Retry storm**:
A metastable failure: a brief slowdown plus retries keeps a Node overloaded after the trigger ends.
_Avoid_: thundering herd, cascade

**DR drill**:
A scripted outage of the home region that measures recovery time (RTO) and data lost (RPO) for the IPO checklist.
_Avoid_: disaster test, failover test

**IPO checklist**:
The six things Pre-IPO must hold at once to go public: users, reliability, SOC 2, a passed DR drill, data residency, and the Rule of 40.
_Avoid_: IPO requirements, gates

**Quarter**:
Seven calendar days of the Public Era. The player sets guidance at its start; beating it raises the Valuation multiple, missing it lowers it.
_Avoid_: season, period

**Guidance**:
The revenue growth and margin the Company promises for a Quarter.
_Avoid_: forecast, target (alone)

**Mail**:
One message to the player from a person or system in the game: advice, an offer, or a report. It stays until the player deletes it, and it can carry action buttons.
_Avoid_: notification, tip, hint, toast

**Sender**:
The party a Mail comes from: a cloud provider, a vendor, a teammate, an investor, and so on. Each has a kind, a name, an address, and a colour.
_Avoid_: author, source, bot

**Thread**:
Mail about one thing from one Sender. A repeat joins the thread; the thread resolves when its cause is gone.
_Avoid_: conversation, chain

**CVE**:
A vulnerability disclosed in software the Design runs. It files a patch ticket with a deadline; an expired ticket starts a Data breach.
_Avoid_: bug, exploit, vulnerability (alone)

**Spam**:
Mail that no Sender in the game would really send: pitches, fake invoices, phishing. Acting on a trap has a cost; opening it has none.
_Avoid_: junk, noise

**Inbox**:
The panel that lists Mail, like an email app, with Needs action, FYI, Spam, and Trash folders.
_Avoid_: notification center, feed, log

**Postmortem**:
The card after an Incident that records its cost and opens one action item: a prevention that, until researched, makes the Incident twice as likely.
_Avoid_: report, summary, review

**Runbook**:
An automatic response to one Incident type, written after the player has handled it by hand.
_Avoid_: script, macro, automation

### People

**Team**:
A group of Engineers that owns one or more Services, or a platform, SRE, data, or security area.
_Avoid_: squad, department, crew

**Engineer**:
A hired person who produces Dev Hours. The founder is the first Engineer.
_Avoid_: worker, developer, employee

**Training**:
An Engineer's time spent learning another language, so a rewrite does not need a layoff. They work at half speed until it ends, then take the language and its pay.
_Avoid_: upskilling, course, reskilling

**Dev Hours**:
The currency of engineering work, spent on Features, tasks, migrations, Spikes, and debt paydown.
_Avoid_: DH points, effort, time

**Feature**:
A product change built with Dev Hours that grows the market or revenue and changes load. A Feature that brings a Request kind owns that kind's Product lever.
_Avoid_: upgrade, perk, improvement

**Rollout**:
The share of users who have a Feature: 5%, 25%, 50%, or 100% behind a Feature Flag.
_Avoid_: release, exposure (in UI copy), percentage

**Adoption**:
The share of a Feature's users who use it, which grows over calendar time after it ships.
_Avoid_: usage, uptake, engagement

**Lift**:
A Feature's realized effect, measured against the users who do not have it yet.
_Avoid_: impact, uplift, result

**Upkeep**:
The share of a Service's Dev Hours that keeps its live Features running.
_Avoid_: maintenance tax, KTLO, overhead

**Spike**:
A Team's work on the running Study. It doubles the Study's speed and takes the Team's Dev Hours until the Study completes.
_Avoid_: research task, crunch, boost

**Tech debt**:
A per-Service percentage that slows Dev Hours and raises Incident chances until paid down.
_Avoid_: mess, cruft

**Rush**:
The Team action that spends the Dev Hours pool to finish a backlog item now. It adds tech debt to the
item's Service when the item finishes, and from Pre-seed a rushed Feature raises its deploy's
bad-deploy chance.
_Avoid_: boost, speed up

### Money and knowledge

**Cash**:
The money the Company holds. Served requests earn it; Nodes, Burn, and salaries spend it.
_Avoid_: capital, budget, wallet, funds

**Burn**:
The Cash spent per second on everything that exists: Nodes, storage, egress, third parties, and salaries.
_Avoid_: upkeep, opex, running cost

**Revenue**:
The Cash earned per second from served requests and subscriptions.
_Avoid_: income (in UI copy), earnings

**Payments drawer**:
Where Revenue waits until the player collects it, until research automates collection.
_Avoid_: collector, wallet, pending

**Insight**:
The research currency, earned from sampled traffic. It has a request kind: a sampled `read` gives `read` Insight. The Company holds one pool per request kind and a Failure pool.
_Avoid_: science, research points, XP

**Failure Insight**:
Insight from sampled requests that fail or frustrate users, of any request kind. Reliability research costs it.
_Avoid_: error points, incident Insight

**Analytics**:
The Component that samples the traffic of linked Nodes and produces Insight.
_Avoid_: telemetry node, research node

**Retention**:
How long Analytics keeps traces. It caps each Insight pool at that window of the pool's live rate.
_Avoid_: storage limit, bank, cap (in UI copy)

**Research**:
An unlock bought with Insight: a Component, a variant, a technique, or more visibility.
_Avoid_: tech, upgrade, skill

**Dashboard**:
The full-screen view of Charts that shows the Design over time. It opens with `metrics` and grows with each visibility research.
_Avoid_: monitoring screen, Grafana (in UI copy), stats page

**Chart**:
One graph or number on the Dashboard, such as p99 latency or error budget left.
_Avoid_: panel (that is a side panel such as the Inspector), widget, tile

**Recipe**:
The Insight pools that pay a Research item's cost, split equally. The split is also the mix the item wants: equal supply from each pool.
_Avoid_: price list, ingredients, requirements

**Study**:
The run of one Research item. It takes its Insight over its duration, and its effect starts when it completes. One runs at a time.
_Avoid_: research job, project, timer

**Insight bottleneck**:
The Insight pool whose earning rate costs the running Study the most time. The Research screen marks it with the Product lever that raises it.
_Avoid_: research bottleneck, slow pool, bottleneck Node

**Tradeoff card**:
The forced choice shown when the player picks an option, with its six-axis profile and a preview on the player's own Design.
_Avoid_: tooltip, info card, lesson

### Prestige

**Equity**:
The founder's share of the Company. It starts at 100% and falls with each Funding round.
_Avoid_: ownership, stake

**Valuation**:
The Company's worth in real dollars: annual revenue, converted at the valuation scale, times a multiple set by the Rule of 40.
_Avoid_: score, net worth, market cap (before IPO)

**Exit**:
The end of a Company: acqui-hire, acquisition, IPO, or stepping down. It pays Legacy.
_Avoid_: prestige, reset, ascend, portal

**Exit survey**:
The two questions the game asks after an Exit: what went wrong while the player played, and what they liked. The answers and the Exit's figures go to the API Worker only when the player presses Send.
_Avoid_: feedback (the board already gives feedback after a change), review, rating, NPS

**Legacy**:
The permanent currency earned at Exit and spent in the Legacy shop.
_Avoid_: prestige points, souls, tokens

**Founder**:
The player across Companies: the record of Legacy, Legacy shop perks, Playbooks, Achievements, Glossary entries met, and the company history. It survives every Exit.
_Avoid_: profile, account, player save, meta

**Perk**:
A permanent upgrade bought in the Legacy shop, with levels.
_Avoid_: upgrade, talent, bonus

**Achievement**:
A badge the Founder earns for knowledge, an unusual build, or a real engineering moment, never for hours played.
_Avoid_: trophy, badge (in UI copy), quest

**Glossary**:
The wiki's list of engineering terms and of the advisories the Simulation can disclose. The game links each term to its page.
_Avoid_: encyclopedia, codex, dictionary

### Outside the Company

**Sandbox**:
A Board outside any Company that changes nothing in a Company. A guided Sandbox teaches one mechanic from a fixed Design. The free Sandbox has everything unlocked and unlimited Cash.
_Avoid_: lab, tutorial, lesson, scenario, creative mode

**Sandbox track**:
The ordered guided Sandboxes for one Era.
_Avoid_: course, campaign, chapter

**Challenge**:
A fixed puzzle outside the Company, scored in the browser on cost, tail latency, and complexity.
_Avoid_: level, mission, scenario, puzzle (in UI copy)

**Replay**:
A Challenge run as the browser records it: the Design, the run actions by Step, and the Simulation version. Nothing sends it to a server until accounts exist.
_Avoid_: recording, save, solution file

**Daily drill**:
The short Challenge every player gets on one UTC day, derived from the date. It never rewards streaks.
_Avoid_: daily challenge, daily quest, streak

**Histogram**:
The distribution of every player's best result on one axis of one Challenge, per Simulation version. Players would see their percentile, never a rank. Not built: it waits for accounts ([ADR 0016](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum/blob/main/docs/adr/0016-challenges-stay-in-the-browser-until-accounts.md)).
_Avoid_: leaderboard, ranking, high score

### Multiplayer

**Online**:
A Company a Room runs instead of the browser. A Company is online or offline, and going offline
returns it to its Company file.
_Avoid_: hosted, live, published, broadcasting

**Room**:
The Durable Object that runs one online Company, with its Seats, its open vote, and its revision. It
keeps the Company for 24 hours after the last Seat leaves.
_Avoid_: lobby, session, server, match

**Room code**:
The six characters that open a Room. It is the only invitation.
_Avoid_: invite, key, PIN

**Room slot**:
One of the Rooms the account can hold at once. A Room takes a slot when it is published and gives it
back when it sleeps or ends, so a pile of Rooms cannot outrun the bill.
_Avoid_: lobby, capacity, quota

**Seat**:
One player in a Room, with a name and a colour. A refresh takes the same Seat.
_Avoid_: player slot, member, user

**Owner**:
The Seat that took the Company online. It holds the token, sets the speed, removes Seats, and takes
the Company offline.
_Avoid_: host, admin, moderator

**Intent**:
What a Seat asks the Room to do: the name of a Simulation action and its arguments. The Room runs the
action and either applies it or refuses it.
_Avoid_: command (that is a Foldkit Command), action (that is a Simulation function)

**Vote**:
A Room decision on a funding round or the end of the session. It passes when yes is more than half of
the connected Seats, and a tie fails. The Exit itself is offline only.
_Avoid_: poll, ballot (except as one Seat's answer)

**Snapshot**:
The Game a Seat renders, at one revision.
_Avoid_: frame, state, sync packet

**Revision**:
The count of changes a Room has accepted.

**Agent room**:
The read-only copy of a Company that its browser uploads for agents. One per Company, named by a public id; the write key stays in the browser.
_Avoid_: relay, share link, session

**Agent snapshot**:
What an Agent room stores: the Game without history, the screen, and the samples since the last upload. It is not a Seat's Snapshot.
_Avoid_: save, state dump

## Relationships

- A **Company** has one **Venture**, any number of **Mutators**, and passes through **Eras** in order.
- A **Company** is stored as one **Company file** in the browser; the title screen lists them.
- A **Design** is made of **Nodes** and **Links** on one or more **Boards**.
- A **Node** is a copy of one **Component**. Compute Nodes run a **Stack** and belong to a **Service**.
- A **Service** is owned by one **Team**. **Engineers** in Teams produce **Dev Hours**.
- The **Simulation** turns the Design into the **Ledger** each **Step**. Every number on screen comes from the Ledger.
- **Analytics** turns sampled traffic into **Insight** of each request kind. A **Study** takes Insight from its **Recipe**'s pools and completes a **Research** item. A **Spike** puts a **Team** on the running Study.
- An **Exit** turns **Equity** × **Valuation** into **Legacy**.
- The **Founder** keeps **Legacy**, **Perks**, and **Playbooks** from one **Company** to the next.
- A **Sandbox track** holds guided **Sandboxes** for one **Era**. **Challenges** form a separate list across Eras, and every one is open.
- A **Challenge** run is a **Replay** that stays in the browser. A server that re-runs it and keeps **Histograms** waits for accounts.
- A **Company** is offline, played by the browser, or **Online**, run by one **Room**. The owner takes it offline, which ends the Room with the Company's latest Game.
- A **Room** has one owner **Seat** and up to three guest **Seats**. A **Vote** passes with more than half of the connected Seats.
- A **Room** holds one of the account's **Room slots** while it runs, and gives it back when it sleeps or ends.
- A **Company** may have one **Agent room** while Agent access is on. Turning it off clears the Agent room.
