## Where the facts come from

The wiki has two sources:

- **Numbers, unlocks, and lists** come from the game's catalog when the wiki is built. Nobody types
  a stat by hand, so a stat on the wiki matches the game as of the last build. The game changes every week, so
  see the [changelog](/about/changelog) for what moved.
- **Text** is written by hand in Markdown, in `apps/wiki/content` in the
  [Quorum repository](https://github.com/elianiva/quorum).
  Spanish text lives in `apps/wiki/content-es`, with the same file paths. A Spanish file keeps the
  headings, links and directives of the English one and translates only the words.

## Send a fix

1. Open the page you want to fix.
2. Select **Edit on GitHub** at the end of the page.
3. Change the text and open a pull request.

Keep sentences short and use the words the game uses, such as **Node**, **Design**, and
**Insight**. Do not type a number that the game owns. Describe the behavior and let the page's
facts box show the number.

## Live views

Some pages show parts of the real game, such as a Node card or a board that runs. They use the
same code as the game, so they look and behave the same.
