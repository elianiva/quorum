Progression has three layers inside a company:

1. **Eras** gate content by company stage. They decide which request kinds arrive and which research
   is available.
2. **Research** spends Insight to unlock Components, variants, techniques, and visibility.
3. **Features** spend Dev Hours to grow the market and change the request mix
   ([Team and velocity](/design/08-team-and-velocity#features)).

Above the company, [Exit and Legacy](/design/13-prestige) carries progress between companies.

Market size is multiplied by features, regions, and Venture rules. It caps user growth inside an Era
([Simulation](/design/04-simulation#users-and-growth)).

### Request mix by Era

Shares of demand, in percent. Features and Ventures shift these shares.

### Era 0: Garage

Garage is the tutorial, without tutorial screens. A player who wants to learn a later Era's mechanics first
plays its [Sandbox track](/design/14-challenges#sandbox-tracks).

- **Start.** 150 users, $300, and one Burstable App Server running PHP with Apache `mod_php` and
  PostgreSQL **on the same box**, connected to Users and Payments. Analytics is linked to the box.
- **First choices, in order.**
  1. Collect revenue from the Payments drawer.
  2. Upgrade the box (it is out of CPU credits).
  3. Research "Structured logs" or "Stripe Billing" with the first Insight.
  4. The box runs out of RAM because the database and Apache share it. Split the database onto its
     own Node. It is the classic first scaling step.
  5. Research "DNS round robin" or "Load balancing" and add a second App Server.
- **The lesson.** Vertical scaling first, then the first horizontal step. Measure income per second.
- **Unlocks available.** Stack: PHP-FPM, OPcache, Laravel, Ruby with Rails, Node.js with Express.
  Components: DNS, Load Balancer.

### Era 1: Pre-seed

- **New kinds.** `write` changes the database from read-mostly to contended. `login` brings bcrypt,
  80 ms of CPU per request.
- **New problems.** The database is the bottleneck. More app servers exhaust Postgres connections.
  Node.js players see the event loop stall on `login`. PHP players see FPM workers wait on the
  database.
- **New systems.** Hiring and Dev Hours ([Team](/design/08-team-and-velocity)). Incidents begin, with
  types up to SEV2 only ([Incidents](/design/11-incidents#catalog)).
- **Unlocks available.** Cache, Connection Pooler, Read Replica, CI/CD Pipeline, Auth Provider,
  percentiles, alerting, Python, Node.js cluster mode.

### Era 2: Seed

- **New kinds.** `search` needs a search engine (Postgres full-text search works at low volume).
  `upload` is CPU-heavy and large. `bot` earns nothing and costs capacity.
- **New problems.** One App Server type cannot serve all kinds well. Work must be separated: CPU work
  to Workers through a Queue, bots blocked at the edge, payloads moved to Object Storage.
- **Unlocks available.** WAF, CDN, Search Engine, Object Storage, Queue, Worker, distributed tracing,
  Go, Java, C#.

### Era 3: Series A

- **New kinds.** `media` makes egress the largest bill line. `rt` holds connections open, which
  breaks process-per-request runtimes. `buy` is worth $25 and needs correctness: no stale reads, no
  double charges. `bid` is worth a tenth of a cent and has to answer inside 100 ms; every Venture
  serves a little of it, and Ad tech serves ten times as much
  ([Exit and Legacy](/design/13-prestige#ventures)).
- **New problems.** Availability. Zone outages begin, so a single database is a single point of
  failure. Users expect 99.9%.
- **New systems.** Zones ([Components](/design/05-components#zones-and-regions)), pricing models
  ([Economy](/design/09-economy#pricing-models)), SLOs and error budgets
  ([Incidents](/design/11-incidents#slos-and-error-budgets)), team types.
- **Unlocks available.** Multi-zone, Kubernetes, Autoscaler, Serverless Functions, Realtime Hub,
  Document Store, Payment Provider, Feature Flags, canary deploys, Elixir, Rust.

### Era 4: Series B

- **New kinds.** `report` scans tables and hurts the transactional database. `job` runs for seconds
  and must be asynchronous. `ai` needs GPUs or an LLM API.
- **New problems.** Analytics and transactions must separate. GPU cost per prompt decides whether
  `ai` makes money. The team passes 15 people and coordination drops velocity.
- **New systems.** Service splits ([Team](/design/08-team-and-velocity#services)), data pipelines.
- **Unlocks available.** Data Warehouse, Event Stream, CDC Connector, GPU Node, LLM API, Vector Index,
  Service Mesh, sharding, ARM instances.

### Era 5: Series C

- **New kinds.** `feed` fans out. `hook` calls slow customer servers. `push` fans out on write.
- **New problems.** Users are global. A single region gives users far away 200 ms of extra round trip,
  and each region's users leave on their own Apdex. Celebrity accounts create hot keys. Region
  outages begin.
- **New systems.** Regions as separate boards, Users per region
  ([Simulation](/design/04-simulation#going-global)), GeoDNS, regional demand peaks (follow the sun).
- **Unlocks available.** Multi-region, GeoDNS, Infrastructure as code (Mirror a region), Anycast,
  Wide-column Store, Distributed SQL, Edge Functions, HTTP/3, hedged requests.

### Era 6: Pre-IPO

Pre-IPO brings no new kinds. Play shifts from growth to proof.

**The IPO checklist.** All items must be true at the same time:

| Item              | Requirement                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users             | 50,000,000                                                                  |
| Reliability       | 99.9% availability over the last calendar week                              |
| SOC 2             | Research "SOC 2 program" and a Security team                                |
| Disaster recovery | A passed DR drill: RTO under 1 calendar hour, RPO under 5 calendar minutes  |
| Data residency    | EU users served from an EU region                                           |
| Rule of 40        | Growth plus margin of at least 40 ([Economy](/design/09-economy#valuation)) |

The list gives the late game concrete goals that are not "more users". It answers the missing end
target that Upload Labs has ([Influences](/design/02-influences#why-players-quit)).

### Era 7: Public

The company is listed, and play becomes an endless series of quarters.

- A **quarter** lasts 7 calendar days (2 hours 48 minutes of real time at 1×).
- At the start of each quarter, the player sets **guidance**: a revenue growth target and a margin
  target. Higher guidance raises the valuation multiple if met.
- At the end, the market compares results to guidance. A beat raises the multiple. A miss lowers it.
  A streak of beats adds a bonus.
- The player can Exit at any time in the Public Era. The payout uses the current market value
  ([Exit and Legacy](/design/13-prestige#exits)).
- Growth slows near the online population. The late Public Era is about margin, regions, latency,
  and reliability.

## Research

Research costs Insight of named request kinds and takes time, and each item is a **Study**. Each
item belongs to a track, needs an Era, and may need other items. The research screen shows the tree by
track, with the locked items of the next Era visible so that the player can plan
([Interface](/design/15-ui-ux#research-screen)).

The track tables below list every item the game offers: 195 items across 10 tracks.

### Recipes

The ◇ column in the track tables is an item's total cost. Its **recipe** says which Insight pools
pay it ([Observability](/design/12-observability#earning-insight)). The cost is split equally across
the pools in the recipe.

Until Seed, the default recipe is the request kinds that the item's Era brings. From Series A, it is
the kinds of the Era before. A Series A kind such as `buy` arrives only when its Feature ships, and
the Checkout Feature itself needs research, so a Series A default of `buy` could never be paid.

| Era      | Default recipe                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Garage   | `page`, `read`                            |
| Pre-seed | `write`, `login`                          |
| Seed     | `search`, `upload`                        |
| Series A | `search`, `upload`                        |
| Series B | `media`, `rt`, `buy`                      |
| Series C | `job`, `report`, `ai`                     |
| Pre-IPO  | Every request kind except `bot` and `bid` |
| Public   | Every request kind except `bot` and `bid` |

A player cannot study Series B research before Series A's Features bring their traffic, and more
`page` traffic never buys it. Items that teach a new kind's problem ask for that kind, so the player
ships the Feature first. The Feature is the production line for that kind's Insight, and no item a
Feature needs costs the kind that Feature brings.

A Venture's request mix changes which recipes are cheap. Fintech serves 4× `buy`, so its Series A
research is fast. Every Venture serves every request kind, so every recipe can be paid.

**Reliability track rule.** Half of every Reliability item's cost is Failure Insight. The other half
uses the item's recipe.

Items whose recipe is not the default:

| Item                                                                    | Recipe                          | Why                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `logs`                                                                  | `page`                          | The first traffic the player sees           |
| `metrics`, `query-analysis`, `eager-loading`                            | `read`                          | Slow reads show the problem                 |
| `percentiles`                                                           | `read`, `login`                 | bcrypt makes `login` the slow tail          |
| `alerting`                                                              | Failure, `read`                 | An alert needs something to fire on         |
| `health-checks`                                                         | Failure, `read`                 | A check needs a Node that fails             |
| `caching`                                                               | `read`                          | A cache serves reads                        |
| `pooling`, `pitr`, `online-migrations`                                  | `write`                         | Connections and data loss show under writes |
| `replication`, `ryw-routing`, `sharding`, `denormalization`             | `read`, `write`                 | The read and write split                    |

**Breadth.** Some Observability items also need their recipe kinds sampled at a number of
Component types. A trace needs more than one hop.

| Item        | Breadth              |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `tracing`   | 3 Component types    |
| `profiling` | 4 Component types    |
| `rum`       | Sampled in 2 regions |

The `rum` rule reads the Ledger's `breadthRegions`. Each of its kinds must be sampled by an Analytics
tap on a Node in two regions, so the Study stalls until a second region has its own tap.

### Studies

A Study runs one item. One Study runs at a time; the player queues up to 8, reorders them, and can
switch the running Study. A switched Study keeps its progress, as in Factorio. The effect starts when
the Study completes.

| Era      | Base duration |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Garage   | 20 s          |
| Pre-seed | 1 min         |
| Seed     | 2 min         |
| Series A | 4 min         |
| Series B | 8 min         |
| Series C | 15 min        |
| Pre-IPO  | 30 min        |
| Public   | 60 min        |

A Study takes its Insight as it runs, like a Factorio lab takes packs. In each Step:

```latex
\begin{aligned}
\text{draw} \left(\text{pool}\right) &= \text{cost} \left(\text{pool}\right) \times \text{speed} \times \frac{\text{dt}}{\text{base duration}} \\
\text{progress} \left(\text{next}\right) &= \text{progress} + \text{speed} \times \text{dt} \times \operatorname{min}\left(1{,}\ \text{balance} \left(\text{pool}\right) / \text{draw} \left(\text{pool}\right)\right) \\
&\quad \text{the lowest ratio across the recipe's pools}
\end{aligned}
```

Each pool pays `draw(pool)` times the same factor. When a pool is empty, the Study runs at the rate
that pool earns, so the scarcest kind limits it. Traffic falls at night, so a `buy` Study slows at
night. The player can start a Study with no Insight saved.

A Study **stalls** when a recipe pool earns nothing and holds less than the Study still draws, or
when the Design samples its kinds at too few Component types. A stalled running Study holds every
Study behind it. The queue row, the Insight card, and the item's card mark a stalled Study and say
why: the pool that earns nothing, and the Feature that brings its kind when one does, such as
Password login for `login`. Queueing a stalled item says the same. While the running Study is
stalled, a teammate's Mail waits in Needs action with an Open Research button; its Thread resolves
when the Study moves again or leaves the queue.

`speed` is 1, and two things raise it:

- **A Spike.** A Team takes the running Study as its backlog item
  ([Team](/design/08-team-and-velocity#spikes)). While it does, `speed` × 2. A Spike whose Study is
  not running waits, and no Team takes it.
- **Study-speed research.** `trace-search` and `notebooks` add +25% each.

Studies run offline ([Simulation](/design/04-simulation#offline-progress)). A postmortem's action item
puts its Study first in the queue ([Incidents](/design/11-incidents#postmortems)).

Queueing a locked item queues its missing prerequisites with it, each ahead of what needs it, as
picking a distant technology in Civilization researches the path to it. In Seed with nothing
researched, queueing Trace search adds Metrics, Percentiles, Distributed tracing and Trace search, in
that order. Every member of the chain must be open, so an item whose chain reaches a later Era opens
in that Era. The 8-Study limit counts the whole chain: a queue that holds 5 Studies has no room for
those 4. Queueing a chain names what joined and, if one of them will stall, the first that does.

A queued Study never sits above a queued prerequisite, so the running Study is always one the
player can research. The queue keeps that rule in three places:

- **Moving.** A move by arrow or drag that would pass a prerequisite is refused, and the toast
  names the pair.
- **Study now.** Switching to an item brings its queued prerequisites to the front with it. Each
  keeps its progress.
- **Cancelling.** Cancelling a prerequisite cancels the queued Studies that need it, and their
  Spikes.

The autopilot's research policy queues only items whose prerequisites the Company owns. It judges a
Study by that item's own price and recipe, which would misjudge a chain.

### Cost bands

The ◇ column in the track tables is a Study's list price. A Study charges that price times its Era's
price scale: ×2 in Seed and ×1.5 in Series A, ×1 in every other Era. The bands below are the charged
range.

| Era      | Cost range (◇)       |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Garage   | 10–60                |
| Pre-seed | 60–300               |
| Seed     | 600–3,000            |
| Series A | 1,500–8,000          |
| Series B | 8,000–40,000         |
| Series C | 40,000–200,000       |
| Pre-IPO  | 200,000–1,000,000    |
| Public   | 1,000,000–10,000,000 |

With `online-migrations`, a migration does not hold a big table's lock ([Incidents](/design/11-incidents#the-six-kinds)). `expand-contract` removes what is left of it,
and `outbox` takes dual-write divergence out of the Search Engine's answers
([Data tier](/design/07-data-tier#keeping-copies-in-sync)).

Four items act on incidents. With `on-call` the rotation answers the page. With `runbooks` a written
runbook resolves its incident kind by itself ([Incidents](/design/11-incidents#runbooks)). With
`leap-smearing` a clock jump does not time out a region.

`bulkheads`, `graceful-degradation`, `hedged-requests` and `chaos-engineering` each add a behavior
([Components](/design/05-components#links)):

- `bulkheads`: a Link option that frees a caller's slot after 1,000 ms.
- `graceful-degradation`: a saturated App Server drops its dearest kinds first.
- `hedged-requests`: a Link races a second copy.
- `chaos-engineering`: scheduled experiments fail the weakest Node and pay Failure Insight.

| `anomaly-detection` | Anomaly detection    | Series C | 80,000 | `alerting`     | Early warnings before an incident peaks                |

`profiling` names each Node's limiting resource and arrives with the Resources
(USE) row ([Observability](/design/12-observability#the-visibility-ladder)); it carries `tracing`'s
breadth rule at 4 Component types. `tail-sampling` doubles Failure Insight. `rum` adds a device
split (desktop, mobile, and tablet) to the Users row; the device shares and each one's extra
round trip are the game's own stylization. `anomaly-detection` halves how
long a threshold must hold before the pager fires, and adds a forecast line at tomorrow's peak,
projected from the known diurnal cycle rather than fit from history.

Denormalization takes 30% off a read's CPU and adds 20% to a write's, Materialized
views halve a report's scan, and Binary RPC halves the CPU a Node spends serialising its calls
([Data tier](/design/07-data-tier#data-warehouse)).

`credential-protection` cuts the Credential stuffing incident's weakness and its
bot-login magnitude once a WAF is also in place. `pen-testing` reveals one weakness a calendar
week: it finds the Design's highest-weakness incident kind (the same score the director weighs
incidents by) and opens its prevention research as an action item, the same way a Postmortem does.

`reserved-instances` and `spot-instances` unlock the two pricing models on a
compute Node from Series A ([Economy](/design/09-economy#pricing-models)). `rightsizing` marks a
Node whose peak utilization stayed under 30% over its kept history, in the Inspector. It reads the
client-side Inspector history, not a Ledger field, so it needs no save change.
`egress-optimization` moves `upload` and `media` traffic that reaches an Object Storage Node onto
an R2-priced path at $0 origin egress, lowering the Egress line by that share
([Economy](/design/09-economy#egress)). `unit-economics` and `cost-allocation` split Burn by
request kind and by the Service that owns each kind's code, shown in the cloud bill panel.
`savings-plans` takes a further 20% off every compute Node's box, on top of whichever pricing model
it already runs, with no per-Node commitment. These five numbers are the game's own rates.

Each item does what its Effect column says:

- `ab-testing` reads a Feature's lift and its interval on the Team card, between 5% and 50% rollout
  ([Measured lift](/design/08-team-and-velocity#measured-lift)).
- `hiring-pipeline` takes 30% off the time to hire.
- `trunk-based` raises the deploy frequency by half, on top of the policy's own cap.
- `platform-team` and `data-team` unlock their team types ([Team](/design/08-team-and-velocity#teams)).
  A Platform team runs the Clusters and halves deploy time; a Data team makes `report` and `ai`
  Features cost 30% less and halves a CDC pipeline's lag.
- `sre-team` unlocks the SRE team.
- `enterprise-sales` signs the SLA and its credits.

## Pacing targets for the first company

The times are measured, not targeted: the Balanced bot at the live pace
([pacing model](/design/16-balancing#pacing-model)), at `SIM_VERSION` 17 on seeds 1 and 3, reaches each
Era at the sim minutes below. The numbers are re-measured when the tuning changes.
