Publish every change from the write log to an Event Stream, and let consumers build their copies from it.

## Move up when

- The app writes to the Database and the search index in one request, and the two drift apart.
- A warehouse, a cache, or another service needs to follow the data.
- Stale search results appear after a crash between the two writes.

## The Design

::Design{id="cdc-feed"}

The App Server writes once, to the Database. The CDC Connector reads the Database's log and publishes each change to the Event Stream. A Worker reads the stream, which in a real system is where the search index gets updated. The Search Engine here only answers the App Server's queries, because a Worker in the game cannot link to it. The stream is **Keyed by entity**, so a row's changes stay in one partition and arrive in order.

## Why it works

The app never writes the same fact twice, so a crash cannot leave the copies disagreeing for good. The connector reads the log, so it adds no work to a write. The stream keeps its messages, so a new index can replay them, and a second consumer can read them too.

Watch consumer lag, not the connector. A slow index shows up as growing lag, and the fix is in the consumer or the stream.

## What it costs

You add a connector, a stream, and a Worker, and each has its own Burn and failure modes. The copy is eventually consistent, so a search can miss the newest row for a moment. A consumer further behind than the retention window loses the oldest changes. An unkeyed stream with several partitions can apply an old change after a newer one.

## In Quorum

The [CDC Connector](/components/cdc) needs [Change data capture](/research/cdc), which follows [Event streaming](/research/event-streaming) and [Data warehousing](/research/data-warehouse). Place it beside the [Event Stream](/components/log). The pattern is [Change data capture](/patterns/change-data-capture), and the older option is the [Transactional outbox](/patterns/transactional-outbox). The glossary has [CDC](/glossary/cdc-change-data-capture). The next step moves reports off the primary: [Reports off the primary, in a warehouse](/patterns/reports-off-the-primary-warehouse).
