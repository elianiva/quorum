# 16. Balancing

[Index](./README.md) · Previous: [Interface](./15-ui-ux.md) · Next: [Scope and roadmap](./17-scope-and-roadmap.md)

This document collects every formula and tunable constant, and describes how balance is checked.

**Source of truth.** Once a number is implemented, `packages/simulation/src/catalog.ts` is the
source of truth, and this document records the target and the reason. When they disagree, the code
wins for the current build, and the difference goes in the [divergence log](#divergence-log) until one
side changes.

## Number ranges

Upload Labs players lose interest when numbers become meaningless
([Influences](./02-influences.md#why-players-quit)). Quorum keeps every number in a real range.

| Number    | Range at start | Range at the end of the first company | Hard limit                            |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Users     | 150            | 50 million                            | About 6 billion (online population)   |
| Demand    | 3 rps          | 1 million rps                         | Users × R_user                        |
| Latency   | 30–500 ms      | 30–500 ms                             | —                                     |
| Cash      | $300           | Trillions of game dollars             | —                                     |
| Valuation | —              | About $1 billion at the IPO           | About $100 billion at 6 billion users |

Cash, revenue, and Burn are game dollars. Valuation, payout, and Legacy use real dollars, converted
by the [valuation scale](#valuation-scale).

Formatting: SI suffixes only (k, M, B, T). No letter suffixes such as "aa".

## Prices

```text
place_price(component, k) = base_price(component) × 1.25^(k − 1)      k = copy number
```

The 1.25 growth on copies is a soft push toward bigger instances and toward better design over more
copies. It is stylized: real clouds charge the same for the hundredth VM as the first. The
justification is operational overhead, and the game says so on the card.

### Cost index

Request values stay fixed. Prices rise with the Era. Every price in this document is a Garage price,
and the Era's **cost index** multiplies it: placement, Burn, egress, and third-party fees. A separate
**salary index** multiplies engineer salary. Without them, a vCPU costs about 0.1% of the value of the
requests it serves, and Burn never matters.

| Era      | Cost index | Salary index | vCPU ($/s) | Engineer salary ($/s) |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Garage   | 1          | 1            | 0.05       | 0.40                  |
| Pre-seed | 1          | 1            | 0.05       | 0.40                  |
| Seed     | 25         | 12           | 1.25       | 4.80                  |
| Series A | 120        | 100          | 6.00       | 40                    |
| Series B | 120        | 400          | 6.00       | 160                   |
| Series C | 160        | 1,400        | 8.00       | 560                   |
| Pre-IPO  | 190        | 2,700        | 9.50       | 1,080                 |
| Public   | 190        | 2,700        | 9.50       | 1,080                 |

How the table was derived, for the reference design at each Era milestone:

- The Stack runs at speed 0.7 (Node.js class) at 60% utilization at peak, and edge and data compute
  equal the app compute.
- Infrastructure Burn is 12% of revenue at Seed, then 18%, 24%, and 30% at Series A, B, and C, and 35% from
  Pre-IPO. Payroll is 15% of revenue at Seed and 20% to 22% after that, for 8, 20, 50, 150, and 400
  engineers.
- Garage and Pre-seed keep index 1. At that size the minimum box, not the traffic, sets the cost.

Third-party fees, egress, and observability come on top. A Balanced design should land at a margin
of 25% to 45%, which puts the Rule of 40 checklist item within reach but not free. The pacing bots
check the margin at each Era milestone, and a change to any value or price fails the bots until the
table is derived again.

### Valuation scale

Game revenue is stylized: 50 million users at 0.02 rps send 1 million rps, and the average request
is worth about $1 to $3. A year of that revenue is about $500 billion. A real company of that size
reports an ARR near $77 million. The valuation scale, 1.5 × 10⁻⁴, converts a year of game revenue into
that real ARR. At the IPO, a Rule of 40 multiple of 13 gives a Valuation of about $1 billion. At 6
billion users the Valuation is about $100 billion.

## Vertical and horizontal

A size step doubles vCPU, RAM, and Burn. Price is linear in resources, as in real clouds. So the
choice between one big box and many small ones is not about price per vCPU. It is about:

| One big box                                                                                     | Many small boxes                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| No load balancer, no network hop                                                                | Redundancy: one failure loses a fraction                   |
| One runtime base memory instead of many                                                         | Fine-grained scaling: add 10%, not 100%                    |
| Runtimes that cannot use more cores waste the size (single-process Node.js, one Python process) | Needs a load balancer and more connections to the database |
| Resize means a restart                                                                          | Rolling changes                                            |
| Hard cap at `metal` (96 vCPU)                                                                   | Each copy costs 25% more to place                          |

## User growth

```text
growth = g(Era) × Users × (1 − Users / Market) × h(A)
```

| Era      | `g` (per sim second) | Time to the milestone at Apdex 1.0 with no capacity limit |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Garage   | 0.0040               | 12 minutes, from 150 to 1,000                             |
| Pre-seed | 0.0022               | 21 minutes, from 1,000 to 5,000                           |
| Seed     | 0.0016               | 28 minutes, from 5,000 to 25,000                          |
| Series A | 0.0009               | 56 minutes, from 25,000 to 150,000                        |
| Series B | 0.0007               | 72 minutes, from 150,000 to 1 million                     |
| Series C | 0.0005               | 1 hour 56 minutes, from 1 million to 10 million           |
| Pre-IPO  | 0.0004               | 1 hour 53 minutes, from 10 million to 50 million          |
| Public   | 0.0002               | —                                                         |

The times solve the logistic equation from the Era's start to its milestone with the market sizes in
[Progression](./10-progression.md#eras): `t = ln(((M − U₀) / U₀) × (U₁ / (M − U₁))) / g`. The sum is
about 7 hours.

From Series C the formula runs per region ([Simulation](./04-simulation.md#users-and-growth)). With
`seed_share` at 0.05, a Company that reaches Series C with 1,000,000 users starts Europe at 37,500,
Asia-Pacific at 25,000, and South America at 12,500. Far demand is then about 7% of the total, not
60%, so a single-region Design meets the round trip as a warning, not as a collapse. North America's
market alone is 5.6 million, so the 10 million Milestone needs users abroad. The Series C row in the
table above assumes one region and must be measured again with the pacing bots.

Churn is steep on purpose, and much steeper than in real life. Brutlag (2009) found that 400 ms of
extra latency cost Google 0.59% of searches over six weeks; the game compresses weeks into minutes.
Fickle users carry the steepness: at the Series C target of 0.92, an Apdex of 0.91 loses them at
about 3% per calendar hour. Steady users leave at a fifth of that. Three calendar days at 0.909
take a region of 1,000,000 users, half of them steady, to about 360,000, not 93,000 as with one rate.
The [Churn breakdown](./12-observability.md#the-churn-breakdown) shows the rate.

Word of mouth crosses borders at `m` = 0.1. With 1,000,000 users at home, a region abroad grows as
if it had 100,000 users of its own on top of its seed, so it fills fast once its users are served
well, and it recovers after it lost its users.

Brutlag also found that searches stayed low for a while after the delay was removed. The game does
not model that lag: users respond to the last calendar hour only, so a fix shows its effect within
the hour. A lag would hide the feedback the Churn breakdown exists to give.

These are lower bounds. Real players are slower because capacity, Cash, and research limit them.
The pacing targets in [Progression](./10-progression.md#pacing-targets-for-the-first-company) are
about 1.5× these values.

## Pacing model

The pacing model is a set of scripted players that run against the real simulation in tests. They
exist because a greedy bot found the current build's IPO time (about 44 minutes) far below the target.

| Bot      | Strategy                                                                      | Purpose                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Greedy   | Always upgrades the bottleneck Node; researches the cheapest item             | Lower bound on time. Must not beat the targets by more than 40%.         |

| Margin   | Plays like Balanced and records margin at each Era milestone                  | Margin must stay in 25% to 45% from Seed on ([Cost index](#cost-index)). |

A balance change passes when all seven bots meet their limits on 20 seeds.

## The dominance test

Pillar 2 says no option strictly dominates another. The test checks it.

For every option set (languages, variants within a language, frameworks within a language, cache
strategies, replication modes, deploy strategies, pricing models, Component variants):

1. Build a library of reference designs: each Era's typical design, the 32 Challenge setups, and every guided
   Sandbox.
2. For each reference design, apply each option and run 10 sim minutes.
3. Score each option on revenue per Burn, p99, errors, and Dev Hours.
4. **Pass** if every option beats every sibling option by at least 10% on at least one of the four
   scores on at least one reference design. Membership of the Pareto front is not enough: a cheaper
   option is always on the front.
5. **Fail** if any option has no such design. The fix is a design change to the option, not
   a number tweak that only passes the test.

The test runs in CI on every change to `catalog.ts`.

## Divergence log

Known differences between this design and the current build (`02f8200` plus the M1–M4 work). The code
wins for the current build. Each row says why, and what would close it.

### Pacing: the live game plays faster than the design

The design's pacing values make the slice feel empty and slow in playtests. The live game keeps the
playtest knobs in `catalog/tuning.ts`. Tests and bots pass the design values as overrides
(`DESIGN_TUNING`, `DESIGN_COST_INDEX`, and the `tuning` parameter of `step`, `growthOf`,
`directIncidents`, `raise`, and `decline`).

| Salary index            | Follows the cost index                                                                                        | Garage 1, Pre-seed 1, Seed 12 (`DESIGN_SALARY_INDEX`)                                 | `pacing.ts` margin at Seed entry (`burnAt`)              |

The live cost index rises from Seed, so prices keep up with income. With a flat index of 4, the
Balanced bot ran at a 93–98% margin from Seed on and held $327,000 Cash at 40 sim minutes. With
`SIM_VERSION` 9 (half the request values, the rising index), at the live pace on seeds 1 and 3, it
runs at 50–78% in Seed and 86–90% in Series A, holds $18,000–$128,000 at 40 minutes, and raises
Series A at 38–41 minutes instead of 36. An index of 16 at Seed stalled it in Seed. The bot keeps 4
engineers and builds no redundancy, so a player who hires and spreads zones runs closer to the
25–45% target.

At the design pace, on seeds 1–5, the Balanced bot reaches each milestone at:

| Milestone      | Measured (sim min) | Target ([10](./10-progression.md#pacing-targets)) |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| First research | 2.3                | 2:00                                              |

| First hire     | 10.7               | Pre-seed                                          |
| Second server  | Never before Seed  | 8:00                                              |
| First incident | 16.3–20.6          | About 30                                          |
| Seed           | 27.1–29.3          | 45–60                                             |

These times are from `SIM_VERSION` 8, where the design pace runs the Team's calendar at the live
pace and Features have [real sizes](./08-team-and-velocity.md#sizes). The founder makes 6.4 DH per
sim minute, so the 8 DH Landing page ships in under 2 minutes, and the bot reaches Seed with 4
engineers and 6 Features live. Before, the first Feature shipped at 18 minutes and Seed came at
35–40.

Before `SIM_VERSION` 8, Greedy (bigger boxes, cheapest research) reached Seed at 31–33 minutes, Stubborn at 30–33, Polyglot
(switches to Node.js through a migration) at 37–40, and Decliner at 43–46. These were not
re-measured; the bounds the tests assert below still hold. Since M4, Stubborn beat
Balanced: Balanced's switch to PHP-FPM is now a migration, and Features build at half speed while
it runs, so Balanced ships its first Feature at 18 minutes and Stubborn ships two by 12. At the
design pace a hire took a calendar day (24 sim minutes), so the hire both bots signed at Pre-seed
barely joined before Seed. Now a hire takes one sim minute. This is recorded, not tuned. At the live pace the Balanced bot raises Pre-seed
at 6.3 minutes, ships its first Feature at 7.1, and reaches Seed at 17–21 with 3–4 engineers and
3–4 Features live. Seed time is bound by user growth, not by the Design: the Garage grows from 150 to
1,000 users in 12 minutes and Pre-seed from 1,000 to 5,000 in 21, both as this document specifies,
and the bot keeps Apdex high enough that growth runs at full rate. So no Design choice can stretch
the Garage and Pre-seed to 45–60 minutes. The tests assert what holds: Seed is reached on every seed,
Pre-seed within 20 minutes, Greedy no faster than 27 minutes, Stubborn within 1.6× Balanced, Polyglot
no faster than 0.7× Balanced, Decliner reaches Seed. Closing the gap is a design decision, not tuning: raise the Pre-seed and Seed thresholds, or
lower `g`. The live game is faster still (`PLAYTEST_PACE`). The margin at Pre-seed's end, at the
design cost and salary index, is 55% to 74% with one engineer.

| PHP-FPM process managers | Static keeps the pool resident. Dynamic keeps busy + 2 and makes 2% wait 20 ms; on demand keeps busy and makes 10% wait 50 ms. No research gate                                         | 50 ms spawn latency for dynamic and on demand       | At 50 ms on 2%, dynamic had on demand's p99 and was dominated. Passes the dominance test on pools twice the careful size. |
| Shared Box               | A third objective: night traffic at 1,400 users, Apdex above 0.9 with Burn at $0.11/s or less. Fastest pass about 5 minutes                                                             | 4–11 minutes per guided Sandbox                     | It was 3.7 minutes.                                                                                                       |
| Read Mostly replica      | A Read Replica passes the first objective and shows stale reads, then stalls: at 8,000 users stale reads alone pass 1% of requests, and a replica big enough costs $2.92/s              | Plan: the replica passes objectives 1–2             | The Cache is the fix this Sandbox teaches. Making the replica pass would mean not counting stale reads as errors.         |

| Undo after 30 s    | Cash settles at normal prices: a removed Node refunds like a sale, a returned Node costs its price, a resize refunds nothing. Redo applies the inverse                         | Full refund under 30 s; nothing said after   | Never gains Cash, and keeps undo useful (plan D17).                                                                                                                                                  |

| Preview cost       | Pre-seed board: about 30 ms for the first option on a Game, 13 ms for each other option (the unchanged ghost is cached), and nothing for a repeat. 200-Node board: about 2.5 s | Not stated                                   | Computed once on hover, in the update handler. The 200-Node cost is 20 solves of about 120 ms on the measuring machine, where the M1 build's solve also took about 120 ms; it falls with the solver. |

### Seed (M5, batches B1–B4)

At the design pace, on seeds 1–5, the Balanced bot plays Seed and raises Series A (`pacing.test.ts`, the
second describe block, `runBot(…, 'balanced', 3)`):

| Milestone                 | Measured (sim min) | Target ([10](./10-progression.md#pacing-targets)) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Seed                      | 35.4–40.1          | 45–60                                             |
| Search Engine, WAF placed | Within 0.2 of Seed | Not stated                                        |
| Second App Server         | 45.5–55.5          | 8:00 (Garage)                                     |
| Series A                  | 63.8–73.3          | Not stated                                        |

Seed lasts 27–33 minutes. As in the earlier Eras, growth bounds it: 5,000 to 25,000 users against a
35,000 market at `g` = 0.0016. Greedy reaches Series A at 53–66 minutes, Stubborn at 62–68, Polyglot
at 64–76, Decliner at 79–89. The bot's autopilot builds Features in catalog order, so Profile photos
(which gates `upload`) has not shipped by Series A; its Queue and Worker branch never runs in a
Company. The Seed Sandbox tests play it instead. Margin at Seed's end is 82–93% live (cost index 4)
and −92% to −419% at the design's Series A index of 120: at that index the build's Seed Designs
cannot pay their way. That is recorded, not asserted; the Margin bot (B14) decides the index.

| Queue                 | RabbitMQ only, 20,000 msg/s per size step; a backlog adds 0.01 ms per task to the enqueue; offers its backlog over 10 s, but no faster than its Workers took tasks on the last pass; a Max length of 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 refuses what the Workers cannot take | RabbitMQ and SQS, delivery, visibility timeout, max length | SQS, delivery and visibility timeout are not built. The capped backlog offer keeps a Worker's inbound near what it can take, so the board does not show a backlog as load. |
| Poison message        | Without a dead-letter queue, Workers spend 90% of their time on it; Delete message ends it                                                                                                                                                                         | Workers busy, depth climbs forever                         | Matches.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Max attempts          | With a dead-letter queue, 1, 3, 10 or 25 attempts (default 25, Sidekiq's); without one, 25. A failed attempt runs again 30 s later on the Worker; a task that fails every attempt is lost                                                                          | Retries before the dead-letter queue                       | The 30 s backoff proposed. Crashes, failed calls and stranded calls fail an attempt; a Worker that drops a task leaves it in the Queue.                                    |
| Prefetch              | 1, 10 or 100 tasks per process (default 10); each fetch waits 20 ms on the broker, shared by the tasks it takes; a Worker that crashes loses `prefetch` × processes × copies tasks, counted against the error budget                                               | Faster, and a crash loses more                             | The 20 ms fetch proposed.

### Series A (M5, batches B5–B9)

At the design pace, on seeds 1–5, the Balanced bot plays 40 minutes into Series A (`pacing.test.ts`,
the second describe block, `runBot(…, 'balanced', 4)` until 110 minutes):

| Milestone                  | Measured (sim min) | Target ([10](./10-progression.md#pacing-targets)) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |

| Users at 110 min           | 22,000–54,000      | 150,000 after 56 min of Series A                  |
| Availability over Series A | 85.7–91.8%         | SLO 99.9%                                         |

Series B is a placeholder, so the run stops on the clock. The bot researches Multiple zones first,
then spreads every other App Server and Worker to zone B and gives every data Node a standby. Its
autopilot has not built Video, Chat or Checkout by 110 minutes, so `media`, `rt` and `buy` do not
arrive in a bot Company; the Series A Sandboxes and `series-a.test.ts` play them. The bot spends its
error budget many times over: the build's incidents last 30 to 300 sim seconds, against 11's 5, 20
and 60, and a 99.9% week allows 10 seconds of full outage. It skips Error budgets, which would then
halve its velocity. Churn after a long incident (a slow query, a zone outage before Multiple zones)
takes 30% to 50% of its users. These are recorded, not tuned.

**The SLO was not winnable.** Over Series A the Balanced bot held 85.7–91.8% against 99.9%. The build's
incidents ran 30 to 300 sim seconds, against 11's 5, 20 and 60. Three changes, recorded here:

1. From Series A, outside Sandboxes, an incident runs at most 5, 20 or 60 sim seconds by its starting
   severity (`CALENDAR_DURATION`), as 11 "Duration" says. A zone outage's failover shrinks with it, and
   a retry storm still ends only when its backlog drains. Earlier Eras keep the playtest durations.
2. A real user the WAF blocks gets a 403, a client error: it no longer spends the error budget. It still
   counts in the error share and in Apdex.
3. An Instance failure on a Node with a standby fails over in the same time as a zone outage, instead of
   waiting for a replacement. Under attack mode costs paranoia 1's CPU, not paranoia 4's.

A well-built Series A Design at 60,000 users (two zones, standbys, a WAF and Load Balancer pair, a
coalescing Cache) with a scripted responder holds 99.84–99.89% over a calendar week without a traffic
spike, and 99.40% in a week with one: a 3–10× spike still drops what spare capacity cannot take in its
5 seconds. The Balanced bot does not play this well: over its last calendar week it holds 95.5–98.2% (85.7–91.8%
before these changes), so it still spends its budget, mostly in the minutes a spike or slow query outruns
its responder.

At the design pace, on seeds 1–5, the Balanced bot raises Series A at 51.9–63.8 sim minutes and Series B
at 90.7–106.4 (`pacing.test.ts`, `runBot(…, 'balanced', 5)` until 130 minutes; 46.5–54.9 and
80.1–93.3 before CVE patch tickets, 62.7–71.3 and 112.2–121.3 before `SIM_VERSION` 8). It moves each
CVE patch ticket to the top of the backlog. Before it did, every ticket expired into a Data breach that
took 15% of its users: 7 to 10 breaches per run, which held seed 5 in Series A at 130 minutes. Its autopilot ships Video, Chat, Checkout, and Notifications
center in Series A, so `media`, `rt`, and `buy` reach a bot Company. It still ships none of the
Series B Features, so `job`, `report` and `ai`, the Warehouse and the GPU Node do not appear;
`series-b.test.ts` and the Series B Sandboxes play them. PHP-FPM holds no realtime connections and
refuses every `rt` request, which alone costs about 10% of requests. So once Chat is on the backlog,
the bot researches Node.js cluster mode and migrates to it. At 130 minutes it holds Apdex
0.951–0.964 with 4 engineers, 42–43 App Servers, and 274,000–291,000 users; on two seeds the
migration is still at step 3, where `rt` succeeds about 70% of the time. Without the migration it
held Apdex 0.881–0.904 with 66,000–104,000 users. The Realtime Hub
([Components](./05-components.md#realtime-hub)) is not built, so a migration is the only way to serve
`rt`.

The Balanced bot does not reach Series C: before `SIM_VERSION` 8, on seed 3 it held 255,000 users at 200 sim minutes
(Series A at 62.7, Series B at 112.2, availability 96.3%), far from the 10,000,000 Series C needs.
M6's exit check (IPO in 9–12 hours) is not measured. `series-c.test.ts` and the Series C Sandboxes play
the Series C to Public mechanics on built Designs.

The longest replay, Too Many Connections (81 Nodes), takes about 2.3 s of CPU in workerd. That fits
the Workers Paid default of 30 s CPU per request but not the Free plan's 10 ms, so the API Worker
needs a paid plan; no `limits.cpu_ms` change is needed for these five. In Node, every other reference
replay takes under 2 s, and Five Nines (40,320 sim seconds at 60 s Steps) takes about 6 s. workerd and
browser times for the new Challenges are not measured.

### Features: sizes, outcomes, and upkeep (partly built)

[Features](./08-team-and-velocity.md#features) now have real sizes, rolled outcomes, rollouts,
adoption, measured lift, and upkeep. `SIM_VERSION` 8 builds the Dev Hours rate, the sizes, and the
requirements; the rest is not built.

A rough budget checks that the sizes fit the Eras at the live pace, where a calendar day is one real
minute. It multiplies each Era's live length by the effective engineers the bots reach:

| Era      | Live length | Effective engineers | DH in the Era | Feature DH in the Era |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Garage   | ~6 min      | 0.8 (the founder)   | ~38           | 28                    |
| Pre-seed | ~10 min     | ~2                  | ~160          | 160                   |
| Seed     | ~14 min     | ~4                  | ~450          | 264                   |
| Series A | ~28 min     | ~9                  | ~2,000        | 2,320                 |

Before upkeep, a player can build most of each Era's Features but not all of Series A. That is the
intended choice. The design pace now runs the Team's calendar at the live pace, so the budget holds
for the bots too: the Balanced bot reaches Seed with 6 Features live and ships the four cheapest
Series A Features before Series B. Upkeep is not built, so the times above must be measured again
when it is.

### Insight by kind and Studies (built)

The old Balanced bot never grew its Analytics tap, so it earned about 2 Insight/s from minute 20 on,
and the pacing tests did not show how fast a player could research. Measured on seed 1 at 130
minutes, with the bot's own Design and a larger tap:

| Era      | Research in the Era | Time to buy all of it                                                |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Garage   | 455 ◇               | ~8 min at size 1, the Era is ~11 min                                 |
| Pre-seed | 2,580 ◇             | 20–33 min at size 1, the Era is ~17 min                              |
| Seed     | 11,150 ◇            | ~22 min at size 4 and 10%, for 6% of revenue; the Era is ~21 min     |
| Series A | 59,000 ◇            | ~4 min at size 8 and 50% (the 512 samples/s cap), the Era is ~38 min |
| Series B | 78,000 ◇            | ~5 min at the cap                                                    |

`SIM_VERSION` 10 builds the design in [Observability](./12-observability.md#earning-insight) and
[Progression](./10-progression.md#studies). Choices the calibration made:

| Topic          | Build                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yield          | 1 × √(sampled rps) per Component type and kind; Failure × 3                                                               |
| Default recipe | The Era's own kinds to Seed; from Series A, the kinds of the Era before (a Feature brings the new)                        |
| Price scale    | ◇ × 2 in Seed and × 1.5 in Series A; the other Eras × 1                                                                   |
| Pool cap       | Retention × the live rate, never below the pool's share of the costliest open item                                        |
| Breadth        | `tracing` only (3 Component types); `profiling` and `rum` are not built                                                   |
| Pacing bot     | Taps every Node, grows the tap with spare Cash, keeps 2 Studies queued, and queues the Feature that brings a missing kind |

**Calibration.** Two bots, five seeds each, 130 minutes. The Balanced bot follows its priority list
with 2 Studies queued and no Spikes. The Skilled probe (not committed) queues 8 Studies, spikes every
priority Study, and fills the queue with the cheapest open items. Each cell is when the Era's last
priority item completes, as a share of the Era, and how much of the Era's catalog was done in it.

| Era      | Balanced: last priority item | Balanced: catalog | Skilled: last priority item | Skilled: catalog |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Garage   | 47%                          | 7/15              | 48%                         | 15/15            |
| Pre-seed | 42–59%                       | 7–9/21            | 65–81%                      | 11–15/21         |
| Seed     | 45–81%                       | 9/20              | 53–78% (one seed 146%)      | 11–20/20         |
| Series A | 94–109%                      | 6–7/21            | 65–149%                     | 10–15/21         |

Before the rework, a larger tap bought all of Series A in about 4 minutes. Now a skilled player who
spikes every Study finishes about half of Series A's catalog in the Era. Era times barely moved:
Pre-seed at 10.7 min, Seed at 27–36 min, Series A at 53–75 min, and Series B at 96–116 min.

Open points:

- `tiered-caching` costs `media`, and Video ships late in Series A, so it often completes in Series
  B. That is the recipe working as designed, but it pushes the Series A tail past 100%.
- Series B's priority items (`hosted-models`, `data-warehouse`) need `ai` and `report`, which arrive
  with their Features. The bots stop at 130 minutes before they ship.
- Postmortems: an action item goes first in the queue, so incidents now slow other research.

[Scope and roadmap](./17-scope-and-roadmap.md) orders the work to close these gaps.
