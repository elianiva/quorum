Use `pnpm check` for the Vite+ checks. Use `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` for Turbo tasks. Do not add standalone Prettier or ESLint configurations alongside Vite+.

Dependencies are pinned to exact versions in workspace manifests and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Keep Effect on one version across the workspace. Foldkit Query is experimental, so review its release notes and run the reference tests when upgrading Foldkit.

## TypeScript and unstable Effect APIs

`pnpm typecheck` runs `tsrs --noEmit`, then `effect-tsrs diagnostics --strict`, which reads the `@effect/language-service` plugin entry in each tsconfig. Effect warnings fail the command. Quick fixes, refactors, and completions are editor features that `effect-tsrs` does not provide.

`tsrs` and `effect-tsrs` are the only type checkers. The workspace does not install `typescript`. Do not use `tsc` or `tsgo`.

`vp lint` also runs the Effect rules from the `effect-tsrs` recommended Oxlint preset. The root `prepare` script runs `effect-tsrs patch --oxlint`, which replaces the `oxlint-tsgolint` backend with `effect-tsrs`. `effect-tsrs` sends non-Effect type-aware rules to the original tsgolint binary, so `vite.config.ts` turns those rules off. The `oxlint-tsgolint` override in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` pins a version that `effect-tsrs` supports.

Unstable Effect APIs fail typecheck unless a tsconfig override allows them for named files. Each override lives beside the code that needs it, for example in `apps/backend/tsconfig.json`. See [Guardrails](guardrails.md) for the rule and the current exceptions.

## Common commands

```sh
pnpm check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm test:golden
pnpm dev
pnpm dev:reference
```

`pnpm test` skips the multi-minute simulation checks (the dominance test and the Balanced bot through Series B) and plays the guided Sandboxes in 10-second Steps. Run `SLOW_TESTS=1 pnpm test` to include those checks and play the Sandboxes in 1-second Steps. CI does not run them: run them by hand when you tune balance.

`pnpm test:golden` replays the golden Company and every Challenge's reference solution in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Vitest browser mode with Playwright) and in workerd, and compares the hashes with Node's. It is not part of `pnpm test` because it needs browser binaries: install them with `pnpm --filter @quorum/simulation exec playwright install chromium firefox webkit`, plus `playwright install-deps webkit` on Linux (`.agents/setup` does both in an orb).

`pnpm deploy` modifies Cloudflare infrastructure. It is not part of routine verification.
`pnpm dev:reference` uses the same root entrypoint with the `reference` stage; the default stage selects `apps/web`.
