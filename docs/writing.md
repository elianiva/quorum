# Writing guide

This guide covers prose in `apps/wiki/content` (the player wiki and the design record), the README, and ADRs. Game vocabulary comes from `CONTEXT.md`. UI copy and code comments follow the same rules.

A reader should enjoy the page, not only extract facts from it. The wiki reads flat today: short declarative sentences, the same headings on every page, and no sign that a person who cares about this game wrote it. Write like a knowledgeable friend who is in a hurry. Be plain and specific, and have an opinion where the page type allows one.

## Choose the page type first

Each type has its own job and voice ([Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/start-here/)).

| Type          | Where                 | Voice                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tutorial      | `tutorials/`          | A guide at the reader's side. Short steps, one result per step, and what the reader will see.                           |
| How-to        | `guides/`             | Terse and direct. The reader is competent and in a hurry. Goal first, then steps.                                       |
| Patterns      | `patterns/`           | Explanation in small pieces. One pattern per page, with an opinion on when to use it and what it costs.                 |
| Reference     | `components/`, tables | Neutral and complete. What a thing does, nothing else. Components share one fixed layout (see below).                   |
| Explanation   | `explanation/`        | The only type with a point of view. Say why, name the alternatives, and say which one the game chose and what it costs. |
| Design record | `design/`             | Explanation for developers. Present tense, one decision per paragraph, tradeoffs named.                                 |

## Rules

1. **Answer first.** The first sentence of a page or section says what it is or what to do. Context comes after. A reader who stops after one sentence should have the point.
2. **Show a case.** After a claim, give one concrete example: a number from the game, a named incident, a specific card. "A GC pause adds 150 ms to 2% of requests, so the p99 moves and the mean barely does" beats "tail events affect percentiles".
3. **Vary sentence length.** Most sentences land between 10 and 25 words. When a fact carries a condition, let one sentence run to 30 or 40 words and keep the condition inside it, because splitting it into three short sentences drops the cause. A four-word sentence is fine when it lands. Five sentences of the same shape in a row read as machine-written, and so do twenty short ones of nearly equal length.
4. **Connect sentences.** Use "so", "but", "though", "because" and "which means" when one sentence follows from the last. Do not stack facts side by side and leave the reader to guess how they relate.
5. **Name the actor.** Say what the player, the Node or the Simulation does. Do not write "The game computes…" five times a page.
6. **Use plain words.** Write "use", "help", "show", "so". Skip "leverage", "utilize", "robust", "seamless", "crucial", "ecosystem" and "simply".
7. **Cut headings that have nothing to say.** Outside Component pages, a section needs content to earn its heading. Component pages follow the fixed layout below.
8. **One idea per list item.** A list of ten nouns inside a sentence is a table or a bulleted list. A table cell holds one fact, not a paragraph.
9. **Link once, where it helps.** Link a term the first time it matters on a page. Do not link every capitalized word.
10. **Present tense, no history.** Describe what the game does. Do not write "now", "no longer", "since M5" or "batch B3". The commit log keeps history.
11. **End on the last fact.** A page does not summarise itself. No "What you learned", no closing "Next:" line, no restating the body in a list. Put a forward link where its term first matters.
12. **A section opens on what only it can say.** "How it works" on a Component starts with the behavior that no other Component has, not with a sentence that any Component could own.
13. **One procedure, one count.** A numbered list counts from 1 inside its own section and does not keep counting across a heading. If the steps run past a section break, they are one section.

## Component page layout

Component pages are reference. A reader who wants one answer, such as when to place a Component, must find it without reading the definition. Every Component page uses the same sections in the same order, split by what the reader came for, like a Terraria wiki page.

```md
One sentence: what it is and the real product it stands for.

## When to place it

- Place it when ...
- Skip it when ... (only if the facts exist)
- Resize or copy it when ...

## How it works

What it does and what sets its capacity or behavior. Short paragraphs or a list.

## Options (omit when the Component has none)

One short entry per setting, strategy, or engine: what it changes and what it costs.

## How it fails

### [Incident name](/incidents/x)

- **Signs:** what the reader sees (a gauge, a banner, a metric).
- **Do now:** the in-game action that stops the damage.
- **Prevent:** the Research or setting that stops it coming back.

## Tips

- One imperative line each.
```

Rules for the layout:

- The one-sentence lead is the only text above the first heading.
- "When to place it" comes first because it is what most readers need. Keep each bullet to one condition and its signal, such as a gauge or symptom the reader can see.
- Keep the headings exactly as written so readers learn where to look. Only "Options" and "Tips" may be absent, and only when the page has no such facts.
- Every incident a Component can suffer gets its own `###` block under "How it fails" with the three bullets. Take the incident list from the catalog (`INCIDENTS` in `packages/simulation/src/catalog/incidents.ts`) and the actions from the code, and link the incident page. Failures that are not catalog incidents stay as plain bullets above the blocks.
- A `::Sandbox` directive goes at the end of the section it demonstrates.
- Link to the glossary and design pages from "How it works", not from the lead.

## Patterns page layouts

The Patterns section teaches system design in small pieces. A page stays under about 350 words, and a pattern that needs more is two patterns. A page stands on its own, so it does not assume the reader has played. Keep the headings exactly as written, so readers learn where to look.

Real-world numbers are fine as examples ("a 30-second timeout", "10% retry budget"). A game number never appears in prose. It appears only in the Design's settings table and caption, which the build reads from the Design itself.

Pages sit in groups, set by `group` and `order` in the frontmatter. A group's orders are adjacent. Foundations take 10 to 19, the scaling steps 101 to 134, patterns 201 to 999, and Outside the game 1001 and up.

### Pattern page

```md
One sentence: the problem and the pattern that answers it.

## Use it when

- One condition and the signal that shows it.

## How it works

The mechanism in a short paragraph or a small diagram. One example with a number.

## What it costs

What the pattern gives up, and the mistake people make with it.

## In Quorum

Where the game teaches it. A `::Design{id="..."}` shows a Board that uses the pattern, then the Component, Research, incident and guide are each linked once.
```

A pattern the game cannot build has no Design and no "In Quorum" section. Its page is "Outside the game" (below).

### Scaling step page

A scaling step is one Design a player builds, and each step fixes what the last one broke. These pages are the only Patterns pages whose Design is the point of the page.

```md
One sentence: the change, in the game's words.

## Move up when

- The symptom on the Board or in a gauge that tells the reader the last step has run out.

## The Design

::Design{id="..."}

One short paragraph: what each Node and Link does in this Design.

## Why it works

What the change fixes, and which gauge moves.

## What it costs

What the change adds: a hop, a Node, a failure mode, Burn.

## In Quorum

The Components and Research the step needs, and a link to the next step.
```

### Foundations page

A foundation is an idea the other pages lean on, such as CAP or tail latency. It is Explanation: say what it is, show one worked example, and say what it changes about a decision. It has no fixed headings and no Design.

### Outside the game page

A pattern the game cannot show is still worth knowing. The page says in its first sentence what the pattern is, then in two short paragraphs when to reach for it and what it costs, then names the nearest thing the game does teach. It ends with a "References" list of at least three sources the author opened, with one line on what each is good for. It has no Design.

## Patterns to cut

These habits make prose read as machine-written. One use is fine. A repeat is a tell.

- **"Not X, it's Y."** Also "This isn't about X. It's about Y." State Y.
- **Dramatic reveals.** "The catch: …", "The result? …", "Here's the thing: …".
- **Countdown lists.** "Not a tool. Not a platform. A system."
- **Trailing "-ing" analysis.** "…, highlighting how important it is", "…, reflecting a broader trend".
- **Three of everything.** More than one rule-of-three per page.
- **The same opener three times in a row.** Check how your sentences start.
- **Synonym cycling.** Pick one name for a thing and keep it. Use the `CONTEXT.md` term.
- **Promotional words.** "powerful", "rich", "comprehensive", "ensures", "key".
- **Signposting.** "In conclusion", "It is worth noting", "Importantly". Say the thing.
- **Bold in the middle of a sentence** for emphasis. Bold marks the first mention of a defined term and the UI labels a reader clicks.
- **Em dashes as a rhythm device.** Use a period, comma or colon. In a table cell, write "None" or leave it empty.
- **"Real companies do X" as a stock opener.** If a real case matters, name it: who, when, what happened.
- **A numbered list that keeps counting across a heading.** Restart at 1, or make it one section.
- **A link as the last three words of every step or bullet.** Link the term where it appears in the sentence.
- **A note that signs off a page.** A `:::Note` is for the aside that does not fit its section, not for the closing slot.

## Where voice belongs

Put personality where the reader feels it: incidents, guides, tutorial outcomes, and the opening of an explanation. A retry storm taking down a service at 3 AM is a story, so tell it in one sentence. Keep reference tables and design formulas neutral. Do not add jokes, puns or exclamation marks. A dry observation is enough.

## Formulas and diagrams

Write a rule as a ` ```latex ` fence; KaTeX typesets it. Write a flow as a ` ```mermaid ` fence; Pele draws it in the wiki's colours. A fence that does not parse fails the build. Keep a diagram under about 800 pixels wide, or split it, so its text stays at reading size.

## Numbers

Player pages (`tutorials/`, `guides/`, `explanation/`, `components/`) take every game number from the catalog. Do not type one by hand. `design/` is the one place that states numbers by hand, as the record of the design.

## Check before you commit

- Does the first sentence of each section carry the point?
- Is there a concrete example next to each claim?
- Do three sentences in a row share a length or an opener?
- Does any sentence run past 30 words without a condition to carry?
- Does the page end on its last fact, with no summary or closing "Next:" line?
- Is every heading there because it has content?
- Did you search the page for the patterns above?
